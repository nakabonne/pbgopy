`pbgopy` acts like [pbcopy/pbpaste](https://www.unix.com/man-page/osx/1/pbcopy/) but for multiple devices. It lets you share data across devices like you copy and paste.

## Usage
First up, you start the pbgopy server which works as a shared clipboard for devices. It listens on port 9090 by default.
You must allow access to this port for each device you want to share data with.

```bash
pbgopy serve
```

Populate the address of the host where the above process is running into the `PBGOPY_SERVER` environment variable. Then put the data entered in STDIN into the server with:

```bash
export PBGOPY_SERVER=http://host.xz:9090
pbgopy copy <foo.png
```

Paste it on another device with:

```bash
export PBGOPY_SERVER=http://host.xz:9090
pbgopy paste >foo.png
```

### TTL
You can set TTL for the cache. Give `0s` for disabling it. Default is `24h`.

```bash
pbgopy serve --ttl 10m
```

### End-to-end encryption
`pbgopy` comes with an ability to encrypt/decrypt with a common key, hence allows you to perform end-to-end encryption without working with external tools.

```bash
pbgopy copy -p something <secret.txt
```

Then decrypt with the same password:

```bash
pbgopy paste -p something
```
