`pbgopy` acts like [pbcopy/pbpaste](https://www.unix.com/man-page/osx/1/pbcopy/) but for multiple devices. It lets you share data across devices like you copy and paste.

## Usage
First up, you start the pbgopy server which works as a shared clipboard for devices. It listens on port 9090 by default.
You must allow access to this port for each device you want to share data with.

```bash
pbgopy serve
```

Populate the address of the host where the above process is running into the `PBGOPY_SERVER` environment variable. Then put the data entered in STDIN into the server with:

```bash
export PBGOPY_SERVER=http://host.xz:9090
pbgopy copy <foo.png
```

Paste it on another device with:

```bash
export PBGOPY_SERVER=http://host.xz:9090
pbgopy paste >foo.png
```

## Options

### End-to-end encryption
`pbgopy` comes with a built-in ability to encrypt/decrypt with a symmetric-key. Hence allows you to perform end-to-end encryption without working with external tools.

You can derive the key from password with the `-p` flag.

```bash
pbgopy copy -p your-password <secret.txt
```

```bash
pbgopy paste -p your-password
```

This flag is provided so that you can encrypt/decrypt without previous setting. Be aware that this way cannot prevent a dictionary attack.

For more safety, it is highly recommended to use a 32-bytes symmetric key generated by other methods.
The `-k` flag or the `PBGOPY_SYMMETRIC_KEY_FILE` environment variable is available to indicate the path to key file.

```bash
pbgopy copy -k /path/to/pbgopy.key <secret.txt
```

### Authentication
HTTP Basic Authentication is available with `-a` flag.

```bash
pbgopy serve -a user:pass
```

```bash
pbgopy copy -a user:pass <foo.png
```

```bash
pbgopy paste -a user:pass >foo.png
```

### TTL
You can set TTL for the cache. Give `0s` for disabling it. Default is `24h`.

```bash
pbgopy serve --ttl 10m
```

### From clipboard on your OS
You can put the data stored at the clipboard on your OS into pbgopy server.

```bash
pbgopy copy -c
```
